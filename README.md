### About

> The key idea was that energy and structure are interdependent, at every level.

You might've heard of Ray Peat through a variety of communities such as health or longevity. He was a researcher most known for progesterone, thyroid, estrogen, and related hormones, but perhaps what inspires me the most was his humanism, stance against dogmatism and marketing manipulation, and understanding of the type of society possible given the influences of biology upon intelligence, perception, and creativity.

The many articles on (https://raypeat.com/articles/) are a bit difficult to parse. This open-source project converts them to printed form. I seek to make this work more accessible and preservable for future generations given how quickly websites go down and how unstructured they are.

Everyone is welcome to participate in the bio-metabolic future, and I hope you might fork this, translate it, put in a pull request, or whatever to your heart's contents.

### Notable improvements

- Format document using LaTeX, a typesetting ecosystem used often in Computer Science, Mathematics, or Phyics but generally preferred for many journal or article submissions
- Improve formatting of references page, inline citations link to references

I do add some sections that were not originally there to better structure the work.

### About LaTeX

It's quite a complex ecosystem. There are terminal commands that you run such as `latexmk` to compile your file into a PDF, many intermediary files, TeX vs LaTeX vs XeLaTeX and all sorts of package managers.

I write these files using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and use the [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) extension. Should you have questions, I recommend Google's [AIStudio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) or any other major LLM.

Here are some articles on the history of things:
